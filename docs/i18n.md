# i18n

i18n works with an home made module inspired by awesome Rubenv's angular-gettext:
`https://github.com/rubenv/angular-gettext`

## Adding i18n in your code

### Including i18n in `<template>` part in vue file

Simply use `v-translate` directive:

```html
<span v-translate>
    Hello world!
</span>
```

Note that node content can only be simple text. This won't work as expected:

```html
<span v-translate>
    Hello <b>world</b>!
</span>
```

If you need to specify a translation context to translators, use translate-context attribute:

```html
<span v-translate translate-context="Message to users">
    Hello world!
</span>
```

### Including i18n in javascript files and `<script>` part in vue file

And also in template bindings, use `$gettext` method:

```html
<template>
    <img :title="$gettext('Hello World')" :alt="altText">
</template>

<script>
    export defaults {
        computed: {
            altText() {
                return this.$gettext('Alternative hello');
            }
        }
    }
</script>
```

`$gettext` accepts a second argument : translation context :

```javascript
const message = this.$gettext('Hello world!', 'Message to users')
```

As `$gettext` in binded to Vue model, you can't use it in a separated js file.

### Including i18n in `<style>` part in vue file

...is not possible!

### Including i18n in messages from API

API messages are not explicitly present in c2c_ui source code. For this use case, add an hard-coded javascript comment:

```html
<template>
    <!-- $gettext('an API message') -->
    <span></span>
</template>

<script>
    export defaults {
        computed: {
            altText() {
                // could be :
                // $gettext('message A')
                // $gettext('message B')
                return api.getMessage();
            }
        }
    }
</script>
```

## Workflow with transifex

### Send new messages to transifex

Sending messages to transifex is done with `extract` command:

```bash
node ./tools/transifex.js extract --user <user> --password <password>
```

>**IMPORTANT**
>
> If you remove by error a translated message in transifex (e.g. by pushing a truncated `.pot` file), the tranlsation
> will also be removed in transifex. When you rollback, all translation will be lost. By the way, transifex will
> automatically propose an unrevised translation that has a very good chance to be the good one.
>
> So, if it happens, you'll have to re-update each lang by checking all messages, and check that everything is ok by
> comparing json files.

### Get translated messages

The following command line will load data from transifex, and compile them into json format.

```bash
node ./tools/transifex.js compile --user <user> --password <password>
```

You may then commit updated  `.json` files.

## Target CI workflow

### When a commit is made on master

Run `node ./tools/transifex.js extract --password <token>` (token should be securely stored in travis CI)

### When a new translation is available on transifex

... but how to trigger that?

1. run `node ./tools/transifex.js compile --password <token>`
2. With git, for each modified translation file in `src/translations/dist`
    1. create branch `update-translation-<lang>`
    2. commit
    3. Create pull request

Last action: user validation before merge in master
